## Overview of Apprenticeship

- **Host Company**: Warner Music Group
- **Duration**: 15 months
<p>
I had the privilege of being part of the Automation Team, where I worked on accelerating processes within an internal Warner Music Group application. This experience provided me with valuable backend knowledge, including AWS Cloud, and offered the opportunity to tackle real-world problems and learn from experienced Software Engineers.

## Portfolio Introduction

My name is Valeriia Harmash. I'm backend Software Engineer (I can proudly say that now thanks to my apprenticeship)! I remember how during the lockdown, I delved into my very first Udemy tutorial on HTML and CSS. It was an experience that left me absolutely mesmerized by the power of crafting a small yet beautiful web page. This inspired me to keep on leaning and eventually I was capable to enroll in the Fullstack Academy Bootcamp, where I learned JavaScript. Discovering Multiverse felt like the perfect next step, and with the support of my coaches, I mastered Python and joined Warner Music Group Automation Team. My learning journey is ongoing, and every day brings new opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.

I love Software Engineering because it extends beyond our computer screens and into our everyday lives. It has not only become a part of my daily routine but also taught me to view problems from different perspectives and ask insightful questions. I have special interest in backened development, with a particular focus on cloud technologies.
